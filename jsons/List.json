[{"name":"mangrove","description":"A mangrove is a shrub or tree that grows in coastal saline or brackish water. The term is also used for tropical coastal vegetation consisting of such species. Mangroves are taxonomically diverse, as a result of convergent evolution in several plant families.","image":"https://github.com/vnysrm/sampledata/blob/main/images/img2.jpg"},{"name":"Mangrove forests","description":"Mangrove forests, also called mangrove swamps, mangrove thickets or mangals, are productive wetlands that occur in coastal intertidal zones. Mangrove forests grow mainly at tropical and subtropical latitudes because mangrove trees cannot withstand freezing temperatures","image":"https://github.com/vnysrm/sampledata/blob/main/images/img1.jpg"},{"name":"Lake","description":"A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, surrounded by land, and distinct from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, although, like the much larger oceans, they do form part of the Earth's water cycle. Lakes are distinct from lagoons, which are generally coastal parts of the ocean. Lakes are typically larger and deeper than ponds, which also lie on land, though there are no official or scientific definitions.","image":"https://github.com/vnysrm/sampledata/blob/main/images/img3.jpg"}]
